## About

This project was generated using the GUI invoked by this command:

```sh
$ npx vue ui
```

The _router_ option was enabled there to setup the Home and About pages.

You can also use this to add it to an existing project.

```sh
$ vue add router
```

For creating a simpler project without the router, see:
